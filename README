This is a java implementation of a CSS preprocessor. The goal is that it will eventually be fully
compatible with the SCSS syntax of SASS (http://sass-lang.com). It's based on a JavaCC grammar and 
is currently in the very early stages, and although some basic features works I wouldn't recommend 
it for any serious use.

Currently supported:

 * Correctly parses most of the CSS specification, with a few exceptions. These will be fixed soon.
 * Nesting
 * Variables
 * Mixins (parameters are supported, although not yet named arguments)
 * Selector inheritance (chaining and multiple)
 
Should be supported very soon:

 * Support for * selector
 * Imports
 * Systematic testing approach
 * Functions

Planned: 

 * Nested properties
 * Parent references
 * SassScript
 
To build it you'll need to download JavaCC and specify the path to it in build.xml. You can run it
using:

java -cp bin net.quenchnetworks.sassybarista.SassProcessor test.scss
