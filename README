SassyBarista is a java implementation of a CSS preprocessor. The goal is that it will eventually be 
fully compatible with the SCSS syntax of SASS (http://sass-lang.com). It's based on a JavaCC grammar 
and is in a comparatively early stage, although some advanced features are already supported. There
are still a few glitches that prevents some standard CSS files from parsing correctly, but I'm
working on getting rid of them. I'd love to hear from you if you try it and encounter such parsing
bugs.

If you need a way to parse css and manipulate it programatically this project might also
fit nicely, since it was partly designed for that purpose. The java API should be rather
straight forward to use directly.

Currently supported:

 * Correctly parses most of the CSS specification, with a few exceptions. I'm working on
   the remaining glitches (such as the * selector).
 * Nesting of rules
 * Variables
 * Mixins (parameters are supported, although not yet named arguments)
 * Selector inheritance (chaining and multiple)
 * Basic arithmetic
 
Should be supported very soon:

 * Imports
 * Systematic testing approach
 * Functions

Planned: 

 * Nested properties
 * Parent references
 * SassScript
 
To build it you'll need to download JavaCC and specify the path to it in build.xml. You can run it
using:

java -cp bin net.quenchnetworks.sassybarista.SassProcessor test.scss
