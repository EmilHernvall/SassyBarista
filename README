SassyBarista is a java implementation of a CSS preprocessor. The goal is that it will eventually be 
fully compatible with the SCSS syntax of SASS (http://sass-lang.com). It's based on a JavaCC grammar 
and is in a comparatively early stage, although some advanced features are already supported. There
are still a few glitches that prevents some standard CSS files from parsing correctly, but I'm
working on getting rid of them. I'd love to hear from you if you try it and encounter such parsing
bugs.

If you need a way to parse css and manipulate it programatically this project might also
fit nicely, since it was partly designed for that purpose. The java API should be rather
straight forward to use directly.

The fact that it is meant to be usable as a css parser has some consequences for the design
of the library. For example, the use of an AST is limited to expressions. This means that
there is no total ordering of nodes outside of each scope. Whether or not this is a problem
for you, I do not know. For my applications it is not.

Currently supported:

 * Correctly parses most of the CSS specification, with a few exceptions. I'm working on
   the remaining glitches (such as the * selector).
 * Nesting of rules
 * Variables
 * Mixins (parameters are supported, although not yet named arguments)
 * Selector inheritance (chaining and multiple)
 * Basic arithmetic
 * A basic if statement (no else if, no logical operators)
 
To build it you'll need to download JavaCC and specify the path to it in build.xml. You can run it
using:

java -cp bin net.quenchnetworks.sassybarista.SassProcessor test.scss
